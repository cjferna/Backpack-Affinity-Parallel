## Problem description
The algorithm solves the problem of backpacks with affinity, where the content of a backpack cannot exceed the maximum weight supported by the backpack and where the benefit of a backpack is calculated according to an affinity. The afinity is a benefit obtained if two objects are in the same bag. The number of backpacks and items can be any.
